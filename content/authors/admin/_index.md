I am a second year Master's student in the Robotics program at the University of Pennsylvania. I completed my Bachelor of Engineering with Honors at Princeton University in Electrical Engineering. My interests mainly lie in Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and Signal Processing. I have worked on projects in the domains of 3D edge detection, object segmentation and recognition, disease diagnosis, and deep learning model inversion.
